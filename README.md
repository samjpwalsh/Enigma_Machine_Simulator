# Enigma Machine Simulator

- Simulation of an Enigma Machine used by Nazi Germany during the second world war (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine)
- The code builds an Enigma Machine from scratch in a modular way, with the settings initialised when an instance of the class is created
- This can be used to send encoded messages or decode messages from a physical enigma machine
